Internal sorts you should know already:

bubblesort
selection sort
insertion sort
merge sort
quicksort

External sorts:  

How do you sort more data than fits in memory?

Adaptive sort 
lecture notes file attached at end of this section
Sort Merge
balanced two-way sort merge
replacement selection strategy
priority queue
(min)heap - leftist, minimum height, binary tree that is heap-ordered
heapsort
balanced k-way sort merge
polyphase sort merge

Some large text files for testing:  Moby Dick and Brown Corpus large text files included below

Some other interesting sorts:
shellsort (also called diminishing increment sort) - exploits insertion sort's tendency towards linear time when data is partly sorted and/or when number of data is small. Divide n data into n/k subsets that are interleaved.  Sort each subset using insertion sort, then decrement k.  Iterate until k=1.
Shell's diminishing increment sequence: n/2, n/4, n/8, ..., n/n
Hibbard's sequence (in reverse order): 21-1, 22-1, 23-1, 24-1 ... 2k-1.
Fibonacci sequence: Start at first Fibonacci number less than n, and work back through the series to 1.
bucket sort
radix sort
