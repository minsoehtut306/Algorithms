# Algorithms and Pattern Search — Java Implementations

This repository contains a collection of Java-based algorithmic projects developed as part of the **Bachelor of Computer Science** at the **University of Waikato**.  
Each project explores a key concept in algorithm design and optimization, focusing on efficient data processing, search, and problem-solving techniques.

## Included Projects

### 1. External Balanced Sort Merge — XSort
Implements an **external sorting algorithm** for large text files using **Heapsort** for initial runs and a **Balanced k-way Sort Merge** for merging.  
Demonstrates file-based sorting similar to the Linux `sort` command.

### 2. Knuth–Morris–Pratt (KMP) String Search — KMPsearch
Efficient substring search algorithm using a **failure (skip) table** to avoid redundant comparisons.  
Supports both file search mode and skip table display mode.

### 3. Regular Expression FSM Compiler & Search — REcompile & REsearch
Implements a **regexp-to-FSM compiler** and a corresponding **pattern searcher**.  
The compiler translates a regular expression into a finite state machine, while the searcher finds all matching lines in a text file.

### 4. Heuristic Box Stacking — NPCStack
Applies a **simulated annealing** optimization algorithm to build the tallest possible stack of boxes under strict dimensional constraints.  
Demonstrates heuristic search and probabilistic optimization.
