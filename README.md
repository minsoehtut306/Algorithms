# Algorithms Portfolio

Curated highlights from **Design & Analysis of Algorithms**, focusing on sorting, strings/regex, graph search, dynamic programming, and complexity.
This is a portfolio selection of code and documen.

## Structure
- **01-sorting** — merge/quick/heap/adaptive sorting and analysis
- **02-strings-regex** — regex → FSM engine, KMP/string matching, automata notes
- **03-search-graphs** — BFS/DFS, shortest paths, MST, topological ordering
- **04-dynamic-programming** — classic DP (knapsack, LCS, edit distance)
- **05-complexity** — NP-completeness, reductions, hardness
- **06-data-structures** — heaps, PQs, union-find (if present)
- **07-backtracking** — backtracking/branch-and-bound (if present)

## How to run
- **Java** sources: `javac *.java` then `java <MainClass>`.
- Text/PDF files include problem specs, notes, or analysis.
